    <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">html (hypertext markup lenguage)</h1>
    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a mark up language that is easy for users to understand. HTML can make it easier for novice users or developers to format, compile, and organize documents online using the Microsoft Word program.</p>
    <p>HTML functions to make it easier for users when managing or managing data in the form of documents on a website. So as to produce documents that are interesting and easy to read by all internet users around the world. HTML has the advantages of the language used. The mark up language for HTML has many sources and is broad and consistent.</p>
    <p>HTML can be run naturally on every website. HTML also has an easier learning curve and is open source which can be run for free. In addition, HTML also has official website standards by the World Wide Web Consortium to maintain. And easily integrated with PHP, Node.js and even the backend language.</p>
    <p>HTML has features that cannot be used logically. So that website pages must be separated even though they have the same elements. When executing, the browser is also sometimes unpredictable. So the browser can't render newer ones. However, you can still use HTML as needed.</p>

    <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">javascript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that must be mastered by a web developer. This language was originally used to make a website more interactive. In its development, JavaScript is no longer only used in browsers, but can also run on servers. This means JavaScript is used throughout the website, from the front-end to the back-end. In fact, JavaScript is now starting to spread to other platforms such as mobile, desktop and games.</p>
        <p>The history of JavaScript begins in 1995, created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Initially, JavaScript was only used internally with the company's web browser, Netscape Navigator. Previously, JavaScript was called LiveScript, which was later changed to JavaScript so that it could become a "friend" for their partner's Java programming language, Sun Microsystems. We will explain the difference between Java and JavaScript later.</p>
        <p>The most common JavaScript functions are for developing web and mobile applications, building web servers and server applications, creating interactive websites, and game development.</p>

        <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">C (c program ) </h1>
        <p>C (pronounced /si:/ like reading the letter C in English) is a general-purpose and imperative programming language that supports structured and recursive programming. General-purpose means that it can be used to create any program. Impreative means language that uses statements.</p>
        <p>The C programming language is a programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in 1969â€“1973 at Bell Labs. The beginning of the emergence of the C programming language began during the development of the Unix operating system by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson.
        </p>
        <p>At that time the Unix operating system still used assembly language on the PDP-7 computer. The PDP-7 is a minicomputer made by Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>

        <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">C++</h1>
        <p>C++ (dibaca: C plus-plus) adalah bahasa pemrograman komputer yang dibuat oleh Bjarne Stroustrup, yang merupakan perkembangan dari bahasa C dikembangkan di Bell Labs (Dennis Ritchie). Pada awal tahun 1970-an, bahasa itu merupakan peningkatan dari bahasa sebelumnya, yaitu B. Pada awalnya, bahasa tersebut dirancang sebagai bahasa pemrograman yang dijalankan pada sistem Unix. Pada perkembangannya, versi ANSI (American National Standards Institute) pada bahasa pemrograman C menjadi versi dominan, meskipun versi tersebut sekarang jarang dipakai dalam pengembangan sistem dan jaringan maupun untuk sistem embedded.</p>
        <p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++. His motivation for creating a new programming language originated from Stroustrup's experiences in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working at AT&T Bell Labs, he had problems analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Given his PhD experience, Stroustrup acted to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.</p>

    <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod">Python</h1>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability of code with significant use of whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear and logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage collection. It supports several programming paradigms, including structured (especially, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "battery included" language because of its comprehensive standard library.</p>
    <p>Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that was not fully compatible with earlier versions, and much of Python 2 code did not run without modifications in Python 3. The Python interpreter is available for many operating systems. The global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.</p>
    <p>Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), able to handle exceptions and interact with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum assumed full responsibility for the project, as lead developer, until July 12, 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Benevolent Dictator For Life Python, a title the Python community bestowed on him. to reflect its long-term commitment as the project's key decision maker.</p>
